## Comment

It was fun to do a project with a graphic library. This is the first time since a year or so that I've touched C++. This project is highly Object Oriented. The goal was to design a Object Oriented Game of Life. It would have been "easier" to do it the procedural way, but it was fun and challenging. I've deepened my knowledge of C++.

## Next

Add some GUI feature (number of iteration, title, buttons)
